<h1>Sorry For The Wild Ride</h1>
<h2>Maybe This Can Explain Some Things</h2>
<p>To be honest, I don't know why I am doing this. I think that this will somehow help me out. But let us be honest, it will probably sink my ship even more.</p>
<p>I am sitting here, in a room loaned to me by my family. I get the feeling that they are tired of me. I've done enough bullshit to bring them bad luck.</p>
<p>This isn't to complain, on the contrary. They have done so much for me. They have sacrificed so much for me. And God only know what else they've gone through because of me.</p>
<p>But...I do remember. You see, I have done things for my family. Maybe not enough or to the level that they would like but I've done a bit.</p>
<p>Let us go back a bit. When I was young, I did something REALLY fucked up. I noticed weird things following me after that. I didn't realise it then but actions travel.</p>
<p>And sometimes, it is those closest to you that REALLY dislike you. I don't know what to say after that, I don't have the right to say anything if I'm being honest.</p>
<p>That led to a few things, I never had the guts to ask someone out in high school. Mainly because I knew that that THAT followed me.</p>
<p>Then I went to Kansas, and that is where shit got REALLY crazy. I worked in IT with Friends, not realizing some things about that. Crazy huh....and even then, I gave it my all.</p>
<p>A little after that, I went to Seattle. That one night, I don't remember it at all but I know shit went down. The even crazier thing is when you realise that it was all planned.</p>
<p>I Kansas is when I started to hook up with dudes. If I'm being honest, it is just for the sex. I like to eat. I can sit there and do it for hours...just eat. I'm dominant.</p>
<p>And not in a hurtful way. It is one of the few things that I can just "turn on", without thinking twice, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>But yea, just hooked up in Kansas. With a lot of different people, experimenting. I realised that I enjoyed hooking up with bottoms who would dress up.</p>
<p>I may be wrong about the following but it felt like they would dress up to "Be A Woman". So I treated them as such. And I would gain experience. Then something happened.</p>
<p>People started to get attached. And that everything I was doing was not so secret. You see, even as an IT person, I was never the most secure with my stuff.</p>
<p>Easy passwords, Heck...I gave them away to people. I never expected them to go through my stuff. I would never do that to someone else, so I thought that they wouldn't do that to me.</p>
<p>Foolish thought right? So after Kansas, and what went down in Seattle, it has gotten even crazier and crazier.</p>
<p>I decided to go back to Kansas and speak with my father. It made me realise something. I can finally understand him. And that made me respect him.</p>
<p>Just one thing though, I know he sees my work ethic, my way of thinking, how I carry myself. I know that he has seen it all so I want to ask him....why didn't he raise me?</p>
<p>So much wasted potential here. I have no guidance, if only he would of raised me. God only knows what I could of become.</p>
<p>But enough of that, it isn't his fault that I am a fuck up.</p>
<p>Alright, this is going all over the place now. I think that what causes me to feel like shit is that I KNOW I haven't been through it like others have.</p>
<p>That I probably have been the cause of embarassing moments, times and have been people's "Demon".</p>
<p>That was the biggest realisation that I had when I visited my father. So after that, no complaining. I'm not a general, I am a solder. There is one problem with that.</p>
<p>I can't think straight. And combine that with the Chaos that I am in. One of the reasons that I used to hook up is because it is the time I get rid of this stress.</p>
<p>But now I just want to do that with one person. Mainly for safety reasons...but my past follows me. I can't save money for shit, and I will probably loose my job tomorrow.</p>
<p>Probably from all the complainints they are getting from people online. Because I get drunk and make playlists for people who I enjoy watching. Nothing sexual, it is online.</p>
<p>But yeah, that is the Chaos that is my life right now. So I am looking for someone, who is willing to put up with this chaos and can guide me.</p>
<p>I hope that explains something. Sorry for being fucked up.</p>
